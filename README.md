# message-to-garcia
Message to Garcia is one of the events at the annual Girl Scout Camp, GAM (short for Gathering of All Mariners). In that event, the first scout is given a message to send using semaphore. The second scout receives the message, runs to a canoe and is paddled out by two other scouts around a buoy. Upon returning to land, the second scout runs to the next scout who then transmits the message via morse code. The last scout on the team receives the message and delivers it to the judge. Points are given based on accuracy and speed. It is essentially a game of telephone with semaphore and morse code.

send-semaphore.ps1 is meant to help the semaphore sender learn and review messages. She will run the script with the text she wants to send as the parameter. This script then translates it into semaphore from the sender’s point of view (it would be mirrored for the recipient’s point of view.

More scripts to be written…
